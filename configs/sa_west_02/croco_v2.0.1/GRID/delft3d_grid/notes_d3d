Grid and bathy generation
--------------------------

Some general pointers for doing this in Delft3D's RGFGRID tool

Firstly, you need to install the Delft3D gui, which needs you to create a user and get a license which is valid for a year
Once installed you can open RGFGRID

The first thing to do is to change you coordinate reference system to spherical (default in cartesian), as our croco models are set up to be run in spherical coordinates.
I found this needs some hacking - 
load a .ldb file (or a samples file - don't think it matters) then
you need to go to "Coordinate System" -> "From cartesian into spherical coordinates"
Then I just made all the settings "1" - it's not important
It will do crazy stuff,
But then you need to go file -> new project and load the .ldb file again
It should now appear correctly in spherical coordinates - check the bottom

You need to load in a land boundary (*ldb file).
I ended up generating my own by digitising the shoreline in google earth, 
exporting kml files and then converting them with a script. (see data/land/). 
You can also import the bathy data to help with the grid generation

Then you need to start drawing splines (edit->splines->new)
I don't know if the tool is really buggy or I couldn't work out how to use it properly
But once you have drawn a spline, I couldn't figure out how to move individual points, apart from the first point you draw
(this issue actually went away another time I tried?? again, very buggy)
Once the 4 splines defining the grid boundaries are defined you can generate a grid (Operations->change splines into grid)

Most NB step here - your initial starting grid dictates you easy the refinement will go for you...:
After a few goes, I found a way that works is to think of what size grid cells you want in your area of interest
Multiply these highest resolution dimesions by a few factors (say 4), to give you your starting grid resolution to aim for in the initial grid generation
Starting with a derefined grid allows you to then apply local grid refinement over your area of interest in subsequent steps
To do this you need to change the M-refinement Factor and N-refinement Factor under Settings -> General
Decide on this by estimating the total length and width of your grid, and divide by your target grid initial coarse size
Go to Operations -> Change Splines Into Grid
Check that the generated grid size in your area of interest reasonably matches what you want for your coarse grid
You'll likely need to adjust your M- and N- refinement factors until your initial grid is suitable
Take time to get this to the point where you have the resolution that you want - it makes everything else easier

The initial grid will invariably be a bit shitty. First step is to orthoganalise a few times (Operations -> orthoganalise grid)
and check your orthogonality is max 0.02 - 0.04. 
Plot this by checking settings -> colour map of parameter, then you can fix the legend values under settings -> legend

Once you're happy with with this you can start refining
edit -> regular grid -> refine grid locally and select two grid lines within which to refine
Start by changing you M- and N-refinement factor values under Settings -> general
Why not start with your area of interest, and gradually use lower refinement as you move away 
This worked for me, starting with a factor 6 in the area of interest, then going to 5 then 4,3 and finally factor 2 at some boundaries

Remember to keep the aspect ratio of the grid cells in the 1-2 range, unless flow is predominantly along one axis
Offshore boundaries opposite the area of interest will tend to have an aspect ratio of near 2, 
with the shore perpendicular side as the long one
Lateral boundaries will also have an aspect ratio of near 2 near the coast, 
but will have the shore parallel side as the long one

locally refining will create steps in the model resolution, so you need to smooth these areas
edit -> regular grid -> block smooth
The default settings for the block smoothing don't do much... Under settings->general I changed the smoothing parameter to 0.5 and the Nr Smoothing Iterations to 50, and still smoothed a couple of times

Keep doing this until the smoothness in M and N directions is <1.2 

Make sure to check all grid properties at the end
You may need to go through a number of iterations of orthogonalizing and smoothing
(smoothing will always lower the orthoganolity of the grid) 

Keep saving your grid as you go! And keep different versions which you can always come back to later.
