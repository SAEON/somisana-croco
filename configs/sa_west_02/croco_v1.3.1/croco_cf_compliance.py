summary = """This realistic ocean simulation was run using the Coastal and Regional Ocean COmmunity model (CROCO). The variables of the CROCO model are originally aranged on a Arakawa C-grid. Here the variables have been interpolated onto the rho point of the grid cell (center of the grid cell), to ensure that all the variables have the same shape. It has 30 terrain-following vertical levels and encompasses the entire Algoa Bay, from 24.82° to 27.77° E and -34.85° to -33.07° S. The variable grid resolution (0.35 – 4 km) is due to the curvilinear grid setup. At the coast, the resolution is greatest which decreases offshore. Monthly outputs of GLORYS ocean reanalysis is used to force the boundaries (grid resolution of ~9 km). The surface forcing for this model is provided by a bulk formulation using WASA3 atmospheric reanalysis (grid resolution of ~3 km). The model output are saved as daily averages. Model output includes: averaged free-surface (zeta), averaged vertically integrated u-momentum component (ubar), averaged vertically integrated v-momentum component (vbar), averaged u-momentum component (u), averaged v-momentum component (v),averaged potential temperature (temp), averaged salinity (salt), averaged vertical momentum component (w)."""
