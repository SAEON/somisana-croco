steps used to create the grid:

M-refinement factor = 60
N-refinement factor = 13
Operations -> change splines into grid
Orthoganalise grid a few times (4 I think)
Change to refinement factors:
M-refinement factor = 4
N-refinement factor = 10
edit -> regular grid -> refine grid locally
then refine along both axes
then orthoganalise a few more times

(btw, if you try to start wit a fine grid directly, you get a very different and much worse grid.
I think starting from a very coarse grid is a general rule of thumb for these D3D curvilinear grids)
