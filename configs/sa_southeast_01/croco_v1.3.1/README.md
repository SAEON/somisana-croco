Here is where we prepare all the files to be used in our CROCO configuration and where we run the model

For inter-annual runs, there is a `jobcomp_inter` file for compiling the croco code and a `run_croco_inter.bash` file for initialising the simulation. Both of these scripts use environment variables which are set up in `myenv_inter.bash`

Similar files exist for forecast simulations, although the environment variables are set in our operational workflow - see `.github/workflows/run_croco.yml` 

None of the netcdf files are copied to the remote repo, only the scripts used to generate them. 

<pre>
Grid input
----------
`GRID` - this is not intended to be a configurable directory. i.e. if you want a new grid, create a new domain e.g. sa\_west\_03. The CROCO grid file was generated by the `generate_input.m` script in the `GRID` directory

Compile options
---------------
`C**`
01 - baseline compile options
02 - as per 01, undef CLIMATOLOGY and define FRC_BRY
03 - as per 01, define ONLINE
04 - as per 03, undef CLIMATOLOGY and define FRC_BRY
05 - as per 04, define ERA_ECMWF (ERA5 blk files are in a different format for ONLINE processing)
06 - as per 04, define TIDES
07 - as per 06, define ERA_ECMWF (ERA5 blk files are in a different format for ONLINE processing)

Runtime input (\*.in files)
---------------------------
`I**`
01 - baseline runtime options, for an inter-annual hindcast, writing daily averaged outputs for the full domain, and hourly outputs for the surface
02 - as per 01, but reducing bottom frition length scale (zob) to 1e-6
03 - as per 01, Zob = 0 (not used), RDRG2 = 5e-4
04 - as per 01, Zob = 0 (not used), RDRG2 = 1e-2
99 - baseline runtime options for running a forecast simulation

Surface and boundary forcing
----------------------------
you'll need to have directory names corresponding to what you have specified in `myenv_inter.bash` i.e. for `ATMOS_BULK` and `OGCM`. For example, in this directory we have a `ERA5` dir and a `GLORYS` dir for surface and boundary forcing, respectively. You can see the matlab scripts called `generate_input.m` in those directories for how the input files can be generated.
