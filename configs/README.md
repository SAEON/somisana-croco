The `run_croco_inter_lengau` directory contains some scripts which might help with running inter-annual simulations on the CHPC. You can copy this directory to your home directory in the CHPC, edit the files are needed, and launch simulations from there. You'd also need to clone the somisana-croco repo to your lustre directory on CHPC, and copy over your forcing files to the correct dirs.
