# datasets used in SOMISANA croco related model development

This directory would typically include the standard external datasets available for download via the [croco website](https://www.croco-ocean.org/download-2/) as [DATASETS_CROCOTOOLS.tar.gz](https://data-croco.ifremer.fr/DATASETS/DATASETS_CROCOTOOLS.tar.gz), as well as any other datasets which you might need to download.

We don't copy over any of the data into this repo, but keep the directory here in case you want to use it for local model development. You are free to work and download to this directory, and nothing will be pushed to the repo except for a few files as specified in the ../.gitignore file. Id there is a new download script you'd like to include in the repo, just specify that you don't want to ignore it in the .gitignore file. For example, we're including the scripts to download GLORYS or ERA5 data in case it's useful
