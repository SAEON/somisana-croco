# datasets used in SOMISANA croco related model development

This directory would typically be used for downloading external datasets for forcing our configurations. 

For example, you could download the standard external datasets from [croco website](https://www.croco-ocean.org/download-2/) as [DATASETS_CROCOTOOLS.tar.gz](https://data-croco.ifremer.fr/DATASETS/DATASETS_CROCOTOOLS.tar.gz)

You can work in this directory locally, and nothing will get pused to the remote repo, apart from a few files which might be useful for others, like the scripts for downloading GLORYS and ERA5 - see ../.gitignore

If there is a new download script you'd like to include in the repo, just specify that you don't want to ignore it in the .gitignore file.
