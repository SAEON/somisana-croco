  # everything below here runs using the `mims1` self-hosted runner
  # This is a server with 128 cpu's and 256 G ram, dedictated to running SOMISANA's operational models
  # It is possible that we may want to use an additional modelling server (which will be a separate node on MIMS)
  # In that event, we could put all the code below here in a new reusable workflow called run_ops_mims1.yml
  # And then set up another one called run_ops_mims2.yml set up in the same way but obviously running different models/domains
  # (note you'll also have to include another `git pull` command at the end of build_images.yml to make sure the latest images are available on the new server)

  # run the model, do the postprocessing, archive the output

  # we considered using githubs 'matrix' strategy to run different domains in parallel, 
  # but opted against it as if one of the domains fails, then it cancels all others running in parallel... 
  # so separating the jobs makes it more robust... and also easier to follow in the actions log on github
  # 
  # we rather run 4 jobs in prallel inside a calleable workflow, called run_all_domains.yml
  # for now this is 2 domains, each with a single OGCM and both SAWS and GFS forcing
  # but this could be changed in future, depending on how we develop further
  #
  # the point is that run_all_domains.yml must use less than 120 processors in parallel - this is our limit
  # then we can have sequential calls to run_all_domains.yml in series
