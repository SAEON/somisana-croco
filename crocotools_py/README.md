The `*.py` function in this directory have been created as part of the somisana tools

The `croco_pytools` directory is included here as a git submodule, added as follows:

```sh
git submodule add https://gitlab.inria.fr/croco-ocean/croco_pytools.git croco_pytools
```

And presently we have checked out the v1.0.1 branch by running `get checkout v1.0.1`

Adding the `croco_pytools` in this way allows us to have access to all of their functions from within the somisana-croco repo, and also allows us to pull future updates made by the developers of this code
